# One Story Point Repo

A collection of One Story point examples that are use in SAFe and other Agile Frameworks as an estimate. 

### Story 

As on [https://www.scaledagileframework.com/story/](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/story/):

>*Stories* are short descriptions of a small piece of desired functionality, written in the user’s language. [Agile Teams](http://dev.scaledagileframework.com/agile-teams/) implement small, vertical slices of system functionality and are sized so they can be completed in a single [Iteration](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/iterations/). 
>Stories are the primary artifact used to define system behavior in Agile. They’re not requirements. Instead, they’re short, simple descriptions of functionality usually told from the user’s perspective and written in their language. Each one is intended to enable the implementation of a small, vertical slice of system behavior that supports incremental development. 
>Stories provide just enough information for the intent to be understood by both business and technical people. Details are deferred until the story is ready to be implemented. Through acceptance criteria, stories get more specific, helping to ensure system quality.

>User stories deliver functionality directly to the end user. [Enabler](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/enablers/) stories bring visibility to the work items needed to support exploration, architecture, infrastructure, and compliance.
